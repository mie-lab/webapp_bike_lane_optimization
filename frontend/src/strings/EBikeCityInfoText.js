    "E-Bike City is a forward-thinking urban initiative that aims to revolutionize transportation dynamics within city limits. At its core, E-Bike City is about reallocating road space to prioritize alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and micromobility options like e-bikes and e-scooters. By reclaiming 50% of road space traditionally occupied by parked and moving cars, E-Bike City seeks to create more pedestrian-friendly environments while simultaneously reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions.",
